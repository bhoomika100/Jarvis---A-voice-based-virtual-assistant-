# **JARVIS - AI Voice based Assistant**

## **Project Overview**

JARVIS is a Python-powered AI voice assistant designed to perform tasks and respond to user commands through voice interaction. It uses advanced speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to enable seamless communication. With its modular design, JARVIS is highly customizable, making it an excellent choice for personal and educational projects.

## **Features**

Speech Recognition: Converts voice input into text using the SpeechRecognition library.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Responds audibly using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
Modular Design: Easily extend functionality by adding new commands and features.
Real-Time Processing: Handles and executes commands promptly for a smooth user experience.

## **Installation**
